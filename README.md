# Stock Analysis Project

## Project Overview
The two goals of this project are: 
- Analyze if there is a relationship between a stock's daily trading volume and their returns
- Refactored our code to improve the performance of our subroutine 

## Results
### Daily Trading Volume and Returns
After analyizing the daily trading volume and the annual returns of 2017 and 2018 for the given list of stock, I believe there is no relationship between a stock's daily trading volume and their annual returns.  Below we can see that our list of stock in general delievered higher returns during 2017 compared to 2018.  However stock performance do not seem to correlate to performance for neither years.
